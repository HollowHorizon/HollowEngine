/**
 * An [ItemStack] carried through the style system.
 *
 * The cascade compares property values with `equals` to decide whether a style, and the render command
 * derived from it, actually changed. [ItemStack] inherits identity equality, and a slot hands out a fresh
 * copy of its contents on every recomposition, so storing the stack raw would report a change every frame
 * and defeat that caching. This wraps it with value equality over item, components and count.
 *
 * The stack is copied on construction: callers routinely pass a live inventory stack, and the render
 * thread must never observe the game thread mutating it mid-draw.
