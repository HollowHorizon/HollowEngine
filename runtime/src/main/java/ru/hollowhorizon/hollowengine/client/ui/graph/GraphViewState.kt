/**
 * Pan and zoom of one graph: a point of the graph lands on the canvas at `point * zoom + pan`.
 *
 * Zoom follows a spring toward where the wheel asked it to be, anchored at the point under the cursor,
 * so that point stays put while the rest grows around it. It runs off [advance], once a frame.
 *
 * A pan grabs the graph point under the pointer and keeps it there; that point becomes the anchor, so
 * a zoom still easing in keeps easing around the hand rather than fighting it.
