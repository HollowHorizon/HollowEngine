/**
 * Frame pipelining shared by every UI host (screens, the IDE overlay, future HUDs): after a frame
 * is presented, the next one - recomposition, style resolve and layout, all input-independent
 * built on a background thread while the game renders, and the host consumes it one frame later.
 *
 * Every host shares ONE build thread, so UI builds are globally serialized. That serialization is
 * what makes it safe to touch process-global build state off the render thread notably the
 * [ru.hollowhorizon.hollowengine.client.ui.text.UiTextLayouter] singleton's measurement caches (a
 * reused width probe plus access-ordered LRU maps, none individually thread-safe).
 *
 * Input still runs on the render thread: call [await] before dispatching so node-tree mutation never
 * overlaps a build, and so callbacks (which may touch thread-bound game state) stay on the main
 * thread. The 1-frame-late pointer/animation clock is the accepted trade for the parallelism.
