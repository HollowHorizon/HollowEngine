/**
 * Everything attached to one entity, under one owner.
 *
 * The split between them is deliberate and stays:
 * - [components] are *data* other systems read - the renderer, the AI runtime, the client. They are the
 *   only part that goes over the network, and only when the descriptor says so.
 * - [data] is the script-owned storage, addressed by entity rather than by script on purpose, so one script
 *   can read what another left on an NPC.
 * - [nodes] are script-behavior, server-side only.
 * - [runtime] is whatever should live exactly as long as the entity and never be saved or sent.
