 * What [UiDialoguePresentation] writes into the UI session, and what the screen reads back.

 * It is a public contract on purpose: the built-in screen is only the default, and a `.ui.kts`
 * script that declares the same id (or any other id passed to the presenter) replaces it while
 * still being driven by these keys. Everything the screen needs to draw a frame is in here, so a
 * custom UI never has to reach into the engine.
